Game Theoretic Conversational Groups detector
=====
In this repository you can find the more updated version of the Matlab code for the game-theoretic conversational group detector. 
The following papers are implemented:

**Detecting conversational groups in images and sequences: A robust game-theoretic approach**
Sebastiano Vascon, Zemene Eyasu, Marco Cristani, Hayley Hung, Marcello Pelillo, Vittorio Murino
*In Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2015*

**A Game-Theoretic Probabilistic Approach for Detecting Conversational Groups**
Sebastiano Vascon, Zemene Eyasu, Marco Cristani, Hayley Hung, Marcello Pelillo, Vittorio Murino
*In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2014*
